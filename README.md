# TetraBin-Nucleotide-Encoding
A method for compressing FASTA files (or other Nucleotide raw data) into a more size efficient file

Sequence of "ATCGATCG" would normally get encoded in ASCII as "0100000101010100010000110100011101000001010101000100001101000111" (64 bits) with my encoding would be "01001011010010110100101101001011" (32 bits)
